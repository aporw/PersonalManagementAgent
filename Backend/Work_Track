# Create main.py and App.js two main files for backend and front end

Day 1–2: Data model (critical)

    Define:

    Thread

    Session summary

    Journal entry

    User preference (tone, depth)

    Even if fake data at first.

Day 3–4: Left panel

    Active Threads (static initially)

    Journal list

    Click → load content

Day 5: Right panel

    Current state label

    Suggested action (hardcoded logic)

    Live notes (even manual for now)

Day 6–7: AI behavior tuning

    Teach the model to:

    Reflect before advising

    Ask permission before deep dives

    Offer summaries naturally

    One last grounding check (important)

    If a user leaves after 20 minutes, they should feel:

    “I see my situation more clearly than before.”


1️⃣ Sketch exact wireframe layout
2️⃣ Write microcopy for every panel
3️⃣ Define what the AI should remember vs forget
4️⃣ Design first-time user experience (very important)



[...document.head.querySelectorAll('style,link[rel="stylesheet"]')].map(n => n.outerHTML).slice(0,10).join('\n\n')

backend:

stop:
pkill -f uvicorn       

start:
conda activate ai-consult

uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 &


frontend:

stop:
lsof -i :3000

conda activate ai-consult
npm start




Quick UI polish (10–30m)

SVG Plus: Replace the + with a crisp inline SVG so it scales cleanly and you can style it easily.
Circular Add Button: Make the gold add button a circular 28–32px button for better visual balance.
Toast Notifications: Replace alert() with a small non-blocking toast component for actions like “Added to journal”.
Tweak Button Height: Adjust Update Highlights height (e.g., to 28px or 36px) to match other UI.

Functionality & UX (30–90m)

Persist summaries server-side: POST edited tiles to the backend so edits survive across devices/sessions (requires small backend route).
Auto-suggest insert improvements: Let suggestion clicks insert text and optionally auto-focus the input cursor at the end.
Disable/Loading UX: Add an inline spinner or skeleton while /summary is running (better than text “Loading…”).
Replace decorative SVG: Move or shrink the state-ornament SVG so it doesn't affect layout.

Backend & behavior (30–90m)

Server-side truncation: Move summary length limits to the backend prompt or post-process to keep client simpler.
Save summaries API: Add a /summary/save endpoint to persist edited summaries (DB or file).
Rate-limit / debounce: Debounce the Update Highlights action to avoid accidental repeated requests.

Quality & testing (30–120m)

Unit tests: Add Jest + React Testing Library tests for RightPanel and ChatPanel behaviors (suggestion dispatch, add-to-journal).
E2E smoke: Add a small Cypress/Playwright smoke test to assert Update Highlights flow.

Developer experience & CI (60–180m)

Prettier/ESLint: Add or tighten formatting/lint rules and run automatic fixes.
GitHub Actions: Add a simple workflow to run tests and lint on PRs.

Recommendation

If you want the fastest visible improvement: I can implement the SVG plus or toast notifications now.
If you want functional durability: I can implement server-side summary persistence (needs backend change) next.
Which one shall I do? If you prefer, tell me “Do SVG plus” or “Add toast component” (or pick another item) and I’ll start and show the patch.
